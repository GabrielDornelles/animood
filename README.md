A high-quality anime recommendation engine built with Rust, powered by semantic search and LLM-enriched data. Finds anime based on thematic similarity, story elements, and user preferences.

## Overview

This system provides intelligent anime recommendations by:

- Semantic Understanding: Uses Jina Embeddings (small) v2 to capture thematic and narrative similarity
- LLM-Enhanced Data: Each anime entry includes GPT-4o-mini generated insights about pacing, themes, and characteristics
- Context-Aware Retrieval: Synopses are augmented with web search results for richer context
- Hybrid Ranking: Combines semantic similarity with normalized popularity metrics (MAL scores, members, favorites)


Quality Filtering: The dataset contains 6.5k curated anime, filtered to exclude hentai and include only titles with:

- MAL score > 5.0
- At least 4,000 user ratings
- Minimum 10,000 members

I've burnt $2 on openai so if you find useful you can use the data generated by `gpt-4o-mini`, its in `anime-llm-analysis`.

Data was collected in late december 2025.

## Quick Start
###  Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+
