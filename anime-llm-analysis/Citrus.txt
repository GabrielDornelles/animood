In "Citrus," viewers are drawn into a vibrant yet tumultuous world where the complexities of teenage emotions collide with the stark realities of familial bonds. The story follows Yuzu Aihara, whose vibrant personality and desire for romantic experiences clash with the rigid atmosphere of her new all-girls school. This juxtaposition creates a rich backdrop for a narrative steeped in themes of self-discovery, acceptance, and the often tumultuous journey of first love. The cold and enigmatic Mei Aihara, Yuzu's new step-sister, serves as both a barrier and a catalyst for Yuzu's emotional awakening, leading to a tantalizing exploration of forbidden feelings and the intricacies of attraction.

The emotional tone oscillates between light-hearted romantic moments and deeper, more introspective encounters, reminiscent of other yuri titles like "Bloom Into You" and "Strawberry Panic." The pacing allows for gradual character development, inviting viewers to empathize with Yuzu’s struggles against societal expectations and her burgeoning feelings for Mei. The anime's atmosphere is tinged with a bittersweet quality, where moments of levity are often shadowed by the weight of unspoken desires and the characters' personal battles.

As Yuzu navigates her evolving relationship with Mei, the series delves into the psychological depths of longing, identity, and the societal pressures faced by young women. Fans of romance and drama will find themselves captivated by the emotional richness of "Citrus," as it deftly balances sweetness with the tang of conflict, making it a poignant exploration of love and self-acceptance in a world that often feels constricting.
