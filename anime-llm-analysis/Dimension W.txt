The narrative weaves a complex tapestry of technological advancement and human frailty, exploring themes of trust, identity, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. Kyouma Mabuchi, a cynical ex-soldier, embodies a deep-seated distrust of the very coils that promise to revolutionize energy consumption, reflecting a broader anxiety about reliance on technology. His journey alongside Mira Yurizaki, an enigmatic android tied to the origins of these coils, serves as a catalyst for profound philosophical discussions on consciousness and what it means to be human.
