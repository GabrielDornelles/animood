In a world reeling from the aftermath of a cataclysmic event, "Gekidol: Actidol Project" unfolds as a poignant exploration of dreams, ambition, and the quest for identity amidst chaos. Set against the backdrop of a mysteriously transformed Ikebukuro, the narrative intertwines the lives of aspiring idols and the haunting remnants of a once-vibrant city. The story centers on Seria Morino, whose admiration for the enigmatic Izumi Hinazaki ignites her desire to step into the limelight of the idol world. This yearning leads her to join Alice in Theater, a troupe that blends cutting-edge holographic technology with the timeless allure of performance art.

The emotional tone is deeply layered, oscillating between hope and melancholy, as the characters navigate their aspirations while grappling with the shadows of their past. The atmosphere is a delicate balance of vibrant idol culture and an underlying sense of unease, reminiscent of titles like "Revue Starlight" and "A3!" which also explore the intertwining of performance and personal growth. The pacing offers a rhythmic flow, punctuated by moments of introspection that allow viewers to resonate with the characters' struggles and triumphs.

Philosophically, "Gekidol" invites contemplation on the nature of reality and illusion, as the girls confront not only the challenges of their craft but also the impact of the mysterious Auroras that loom over their lives. This anime speaks to those who are drawn to stories of resilience and self-discovery, enveloped in a rich tapestry of emotional depth and artistic expression.
