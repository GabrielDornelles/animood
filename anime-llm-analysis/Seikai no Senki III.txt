The anime explores themes of authority, identity, and the burdens of leadership, inviting viewers to reflect on the complexities of power and allegiance. As Jinto navigates the political landscape of the Hyde System, recently returned to imperial control, the tension between his loyalties and the expectations of his role as an Earl becomes palpable.
