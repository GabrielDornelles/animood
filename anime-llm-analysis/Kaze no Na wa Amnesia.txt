In a world ravaged by an inexplicable wind that erases all memories, "Kaze no Na wa Amnesia" delves into the fragility of human identity and the essence of what it means to be alive. The narrative follows Wataru, a young man thrust into an apocalyptic landscape where civilization has crumbled, and the echoes of humanity are mere whispers. As he embarks on a poignant journey across a desolate America, the film explores themes of memory, identity, and the cyclical nature of existence, reminiscent of works like "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time" and "Steins;Gate," where time and memory intertwine to shape human experience.

The emotional tone oscillates between despair and hope, as Wataru, guided by the enigmatic Sophia, seeks to reclaim not only his own lost identity but also the remnants of humanity that linger in the ruins of society. Their companionship unfolds against a backdrop of haunting visuals, capturing the stark beauty of a world stripped of its history, inviting viewers to ponder the depth of human connection in the face of obliteration. The pacing is deliberate, allowing for introspective moments that resonate with viewers who appreciate philosophical musings akin to "Ghost in the Shell."

It speaks to viewers seeking a narrative rich in emotional depth, where the struggle for identity amidst chaos offers a reflective mirror to our own reliance on memory and knowledge. With its mature themes and contemplative atmosphere, "Kaze no Na wa Amnesia" invites audiences to reflect on the essence of humanity in a world where everything familiar has vanished.
