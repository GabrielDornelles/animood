This anime delves into the dark underbelly of the human psyche, where gifted individuals known as "Imagers" wield the power to navigate and distort memories. The narrative unfolds with a tension that echoes the psychological intricacies found in works like "Paranoia Agent" and "Serial Experiments Lain," inviting audiences to ponder the fragility of their own recollections and the moral implications of such abilities.

The intimate yet intense dynamics between characters hint at homoerotic undertones, adding depth to their interactions.
