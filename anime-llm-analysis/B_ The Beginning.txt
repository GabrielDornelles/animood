The narrative unfolds with an electrifying pulse, drawing viewers into a world where the enigmatic vigilante, Killer B, embodies both savior and scourge. His superhuman abilities and razor-sharp blade carve a path through a city rife with corruption, inviting comparisons to the morally complex landscapes of "Psycho-Pass" and "Death Note." 

At the center of this dark tapestry is Keith Flick, an eccentric detective grappling with personal demons, reminiscent of the troubled protagonists in "Paranoia Agent."
