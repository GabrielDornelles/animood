The story revolves around Orphen, a once-promising sorcerer whose life is irrevocably altered by a tragic incident involving his sister, Azalie, who is transformed into a dragon. This transformation serves as a haunting metaphor for loss and the consequences of ambition, echoing themes found in darker fantasy tales like "Berserk" or "Made in Abyss," where characters grapple with the weight of their past choices.

The series delves into the psychological turmoil of its characters, especially Orphen, who embodies the struggle of balancing personal desires with the burden of responsibility. His journey is not merely a quest for magical solutions; it is a profound exploration of familial bonds, sacrifice, and the complexities of morality within a society that often prioritizes reputation over truth.

As Orphen navigates a world filled with formidable foes and moral ambiguity, the stakes feel palpably high, creating a visceral sense of danger that resonates deeply with viewers seeking stories that reflect real emotional stakes. The philosophical undercurrents challenge the notion of strength, asking what it truly means to be powerful in a world rife with suffering and deception. This anime speaks to those in search of narratives that are both thrilling and thought-provoking, appealing to fans of emotional depth and character-driven plots.
