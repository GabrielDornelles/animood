As the narrative delves into themes of friendship, resilience, and personal growth, the emotional landscape shifts from light-hearted school life to a poignant exploration of human connections. The dynamic between Ai, who embodies nurturing warmth, and Mio, whose grumpy demeanor masks deeper insecurities, creates a rich tapestry of interpersonal conflict and support.
