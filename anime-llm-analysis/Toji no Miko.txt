This anime explores the psychological toll of duty as elite shrine maidens, known as Toji, battle against the malevolent Aratama, embodying themes of sacrifice and loyalty. The protagonist, Kanami Etou, is thrust into a gripping sword-fighting tournament that serves as a crucible for her character, revealing the fragility of alliances and the weight of expectations. 

As the stakes escalate, the atmosphere shifts from the thrill of competition to the eerie tension of impending doom, reminiscent of works like "Fate/Zero" and "Madoka Magica," where seemingly innocuous settings hide darker realities.
