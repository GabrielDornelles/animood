In the labyrinthine remnants of Kowloon Walled City, a tapestry of nostalgia intertwines with the bittersweet realities of love and memory. This anime transports viewers into a densely packed urban landscape, where flickering streetlights cast shadows on the complex lives of its inhabitants. Central to this tale is Reiko Kujirai, a 32-year-old realtor, whose unspoken affection for her younger coworker, Hajime Kudou, serves as the emotional core. Their dynamic, marked by moments of tenderness and miscommunication, explores the delicate balance between desire and the fear of vulnerability.

As the narrative unfolds, the surreal atmosphere of Kowloon enhances themes of emotional isolation and self-discovery. The city's crumbling walls echo the characters' internal struggles, creating a poignant backdrop for their journey. The accidental kiss that ignites a cascade of introspection reveals the fragility of human connections and the complexities of unrequited love. This intricate interplay between past and present invites viewers to reflect on their own memories and longings, reminiscent of other reflective works like "After the Rain" and "Your Lie in April," where the weight of nostalgia profoundly shapes character arcs.

The pacing is contemplative, allowing the audience to linger in moments of introspection, while the stunning visuals evoke a sense of beauty amidst decay. This anime resonates deeply with viewers seeking a meditative experience, one that grapples with the nuances of love, regret, and the passage of time. It appeals to those who appreciate character-driven narratives rich in psychological depth, enveloped in a melancholic yet hopeful tone.
