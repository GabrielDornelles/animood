The pacing is deliberate, allowing for deep character development while interspersing moments of tension and conflict, primarily driven by the menacing youma. This juxtaposition of introspective moments and high-stakes encounters creates a narrative rhythm that resonates with viewers seeking emotional depth rather than mere action.
