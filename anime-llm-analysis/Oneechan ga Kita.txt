In "Oneechan ga Kita," the narrative unfolds around Tomoya Mizuhara, a 13-year-old boy whose life takes a whimsical turn when his father remarries, introducing him to the eccentricity of a big sister, Ichika. This slice-of-life comedy intricately blends humor with an exploration of sibling dynamics, touching on themes of affection, awkwardness, and the nuances of familial love. Ichika's quirky personality, characterized by an overwhelming, almost obsessive affection for her younger brother, creates a tension that oscillates between endearing and unsettling, reminiscent of the emotional complexity found in series like "Kawaii Dake ja Nai Shikimori-san" or "Oreimo."
