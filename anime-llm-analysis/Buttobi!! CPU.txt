In the eccentric world of "Buttobi!! CPU," viewers are thrust into a surreal blend of absurdity and humor, exploring themes of technology, identity, and the bizarre intersections of human and machine. The narrative revolves around Akira Takaoka, a socially awkward protagonist yearning for acceptance within the Electric Brain Study Society. His quest for a computer spirals into a wild escapade when he acquires a bio-type PC2198, Mimi, who demands a rather unconventional source of energy to function. This outrageous premise sets the stage for a comedic exploration of embarrassment, societal expectations, and the lengths one might go to fit in.

The atmosphere oscillates between playful and risqué, infused with a sense of urgency as Akira grapples with the absurd demands of his new companion while fending off the sinister Apple Nacintosh sisters. The pacing is brisk, mirroring the frenetic energy of Akira's escapades, and the humor, while at times crude, resonates with those who appreciate offbeat comedies reminiscent of "FLCL" or "Baka and Test."
