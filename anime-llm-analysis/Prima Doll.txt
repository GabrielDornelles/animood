The atmosphere is imbued with a sense of nostalgia and melancholy, as the characters grapple with the remnants of their tumultuous pasts while striving to forge new connections and roles in a world that feels foreign to them.

At the center of this emotional tapestry is Haizakura, a recently restored automaton whose lost memories create a poignant exploration of self-discovery. Her enchanting voice serves as a beacon of hope, guiding her and her companions in their quest for meaning beyond their programmed origins. The pacing is gentle yet introspective, inviting viewers to linger on each character's journey as they confront their histories and embrace the uncertainty of their futures.
