The story centers on a military unit tasked with hunting vampires, yet these creatures are not mere monsters; they are tragic figures wrestling with their identity and the remnants of their humanity. The psychological depth of each character, particularly Colonel Yoshinobu Maeda, evokes a profound sense of empathy as he navigates the pressures of duty and the weight of his comrades' transformations.
