The series captures the fragility of the human psyche, exploring themes of isolation, bullying, and the consequences of seemingly trivial actions.

The atmosphere is thick with tension, the pacing deliberate, allowing dread to seep into every moment. Each story is crafted with a minimalist aesthetic reminiscent of traditional Japanese storytelling, yet it resonates with contemporary fears that echo through the lives of its characters.
