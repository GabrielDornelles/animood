In "Figure 17: Tsubasa & Hikaru," the narrative intricately weaves the themes of isolation, identity, and the burdens of newfound responsibilities against a backdrop of sci-fi adventure. Tsubasa Shiina, a quiet and withdrawn 10-year-old, grapples with the emotional turmoil of relocating to Hokkaido, where her struggles to connect with peers mirror a deeper longing for acceptance. This loneliness transforms dramatically when she encounters an alien lifeform, Hikaru, who not only becomes her protector but also an extension of herself, embodying the complexities of companionship and self-discovery.

The series artfully balances its magical girl elements with poignant psychological depth, exploring Tsubasa's evolution from a timid girl to a courageous fighter. As she learns to wield the Riberus battle armor, the show delves into themes of trauma and the duality of her existence—straddling the line between childhood innocence and the harsh realities of her alien battles. The pacing is deliberate, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in Tsubasa’s emotional landscape, punctuated by moments of levity and the bittersweet nature of growing up.

This anime resonates with those seeking a reflective experience, particularly fans of shows like "Madoka Magica" and "Anohana," where the blend of heart and struggle prevails. The atmosphere is a gentle yet haunting exploration of the human condition, inviting viewers to reflect on their own journeys through friendship, fear, and the quest for belonging.
