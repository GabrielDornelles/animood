The story follows Haruka Nanase, a talented swimmer whose deep connection to water symbolizes both freedom and vulnerability. As he navigates the turbulent waters of rekindled friendships and fierce competition, the atmosphere oscillates between nostalgia and the bittersweet pangs of growing apart.
