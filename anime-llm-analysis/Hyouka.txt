Centered around Houtarou Oreki, an apathetic student who seeks to conserve energy in every aspect of life, the narrative blossoms when he is drawn into the Classics Club by the vivacious Eru Chitanda. Her boundless enthusiasm serves as a catalyst, propelling Oreki and his friends, Satoshi and Mayaka, into a series of light yet profound mysteries that reflect the intricacies of everyday existence.
