In a tumultuous world brimming with dragons and the arcane art of Jushiki, "Saredo Tsumibito wa Ryuu to Odoru" invites viewers into a chaotic narrative where the boundaries of magic and reality blur. The story follows Gayus, a sorcerer grappling with misfortune, who becomes entangled with the enigmatic and ruthless Gigina. Together, they navigate a landscape fraught with danger as bounty hunters, only to find themselves caught in a web of intrigue at a grand festival overseen by the kingdom's ruler, Mouldeen. This setting amplifies the tension, as a series of brutal murders targeting Jushiki practitioners unfolds, creating an atmosphere thick with paranoia and suspense.

The pacing, at times erratic, mirrors the frenetic energy of its protagonists, echoing the thematic complexity found in works like "Baccano!" and "Fate/Zero." The intertwining elements of politics, action, and fantasy offer a rich tapestry that challenges viewers to ponder the nature of power and morality. The psychological depth of the characters, especially the contrasting motivations of Gayus and Gigina, resonates with those who appreciate morally ambiguous narratives, akin to "Psycho-Pass."

As the series progresses, the emotional tone oscillates between dark humor and grim seriousness, making it a compelling watch for viewers seeking a blend of action and philosophical musings. The narrative's exploration of the consequences of wielding immense power and the fragility of human life adds layers of existential reflection, appealing to audiences drawn to thought-provoking anime.
