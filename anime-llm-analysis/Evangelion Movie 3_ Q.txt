In "Evangelion Movie 3: Q," viewers are thrust into a hauntingly desolate world, fourteen years after the cataclysmic Third Impact.

This film explores profound themes of identity, loss, and the struggle for redemption, echoing the psychological complexities found in works like "Serial Experiments Lain" and "The End of Evangelion." 

Shinji's journey unfolds against a backdrop of post-apocalyptic despair, where familiar faces have morphed into shadows of their former selves.
