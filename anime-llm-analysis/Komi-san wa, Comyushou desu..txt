Despite her striking beauty and grace, Komi's internal battle with communication disorder creates a poignant contrast, inviting viewers to delve into the complexities of social interaction. The series masterfully blends lighthearted humor with deeper emotional currents, reminiscent of works like "March Comes in Like a Lion" and "Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day," both of which tackle themes of loneliness and the quest for understanding.
