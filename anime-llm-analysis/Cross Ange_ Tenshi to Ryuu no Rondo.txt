In "Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo," viewers are plunged into a tumultuous world where societal norms dictate worth and power, leading to intense emotional upheaval. The narrative intricately weaves themes of identity, discrimination, and redemption through the journey of Angelise Ikaruga Misurugi, a once-revered princess who is thrust into the depths of despair upon discovering she is a "Norma," an outcast in a society that worships the ability to wield Mana. This revelation ignites a fiery exploration of self-worth and the struggle against oppressive societal structures.

The atmosphere is laden with tension as Angelise transitions from royalty to a soldier in a remote military base, Arzenal, where she must confront not only external threats from the monstrous DRAGONs but also the internal battles of acceptance and resilience.
