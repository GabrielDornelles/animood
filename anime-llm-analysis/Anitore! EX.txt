"Anitore! EX" offers a unique blend of slice-of-life charm and fitness motivation, encapsulating the journey of six aspiring idols as they engage viewers in a variety of exercise routines, from yoga to dance. This anime presents a lighthearted atmosphere, inviting audiences to participate in physical activity while fostering a sense of camaraderie among the characters. However, beneath its cheerful facade lies a narrative that can frustrate, as the characters often lean into irritating tropes, making it challenging for viewers to connect with them deeply. 

The pacing is brisk, filled with energetic sequences that juxtapose the characters’ struggles with their aspirations. This creates a curious tension between motivation and annoyance, reminiscent of series like "K-On!" and "Aikatsu!", where the pursuit of dreams is central, yet the execution can lead to mixed feelings. While the intention is to inspire, the superficial character development may leave some viewers yearning for more depth, echoing sentiments found in shows like "Love Live!" where character arcs are more fleshed out.

For those seeking a light workout companion or a dose of cheerful exercise motivation, "Anitore! EX" provides a playful experience. However, it may not resonate with viewers looking for profound storytelling or nuanced character exploration. Instead, it appeals to those in a mood for playful, albeit frustrating, entertainment that nudges them to get moving, even if the characters themselves can be a source of irritation.
