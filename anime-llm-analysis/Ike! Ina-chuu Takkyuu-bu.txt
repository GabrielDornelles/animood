This anime delves into themes of camaraderie, adolescent rebellion, and the struggle for identity amidst the pressures of youth. The narrative centers on a motley crew of junior high students whose apathy is ignited by their new manager, Kyoko Iwashita, who employs unconventional methods to motivate her team, including the notorious "sex pass." This provocative plot device serves as a catalyst for exploring deeper psychological dynamics, such as the blurred lines between personal ambition and team spirit.
