In a world where the nobility often overlooks the underprivileged, *Isshun de Chiryou shiteita noni Yakutatazu to Tsuihou sareta Tensai Chiyushi, Yami Healer toshite Tanoshiku Ikiru* delves deep into themes of redemption, societal disparity, and the quiet power of compassion. Zenos, a self-taught healer born into poverty, embodies the struggle of those marginalized by circumstance, seeking to carve out a life not defined by his past. His journey is both a personal and philosophical exploration of what it means to truly heal, not just physically but emotionally and socially, as he works in the shadows to serve those shunned by society.

The narrative unfolds with a blend of fantasy and introspective drama, reminiscent of series like *Mushoku Tensei* and *Re:Zero*, where character growth is intertwined with moral dilemmas.
