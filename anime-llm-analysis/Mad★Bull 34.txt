Mad★Bull 34 is a chaotic blend of gritty urban action and dark humor, set against the backdrop of 1980s New York City. The narrative revolves around Daizaburo Edi-Ban, an earnest newcomer to a precinct defined by lawlessness and corruption. Partnered with the notorious John "Mad Bull" Estes, a rogue cop who embodies a reckless and brutal form of justice, viewers are thrust into a world where morality is often overshadowed by violence. This anime juxtaposes the extreme measures taken by Mad Bull—who doesn’t hesitate to unleash lethal force against minor threats—with moments of unexpected compassion, as he channels ill-gotten gains into charitable causes.

The animation, while dated and rough around the edges, captures the frenetic energy of the city and the frenetic pace of the story, evoking a sense of urgency and danger. The absurdity of the situations, combined with the interplay of dark comedy and serious themes, creates an emotional landscape that resonates with those seeking a wild ride through the underbelly of society. The camaraderie between the characters, especially the dynamic between the impulsive Mad Bull and the more level-headed Daizaburo, adds layers of psychological tension and camaraderie reminiscent of classics like "Dirty Pair" and "City Hunter."

Fans of over-the-top violence and irreverent humor will find themselves drawn to the unapologetic chaos that defines this series. It’s a visceral experience for viewers looking for an adrenaline rush mixed with moral ambiguity, where every episode dances on the edge of absurdity and seriousness, inviting contemplation on justice and humanity.
