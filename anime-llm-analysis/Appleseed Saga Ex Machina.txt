The story revolves around Deunan, a fierce and resilient warrior, and Briareos, a battle-hardened cyborg. Their relationship, both romantic and professional, is intricately woven into a narrative rich with themes of identity, loyalty, and the moral dilemmas posed by advanced artificial intelligence. The introduction of Tereus, an experimental Bioroid, complicates their partnership, inviting philosophical questions about consciousness, autonomy, and the essence of being human.
