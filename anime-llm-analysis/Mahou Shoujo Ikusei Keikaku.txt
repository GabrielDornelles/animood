In the shadowy realm of N-City, "Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku" thrusts its young female protagonists into a harrowing contest that blurs the lines between fantasy and grim reality. The narrative unfolds as Koyuki Himekawa, transformed into the magical girl Snow White, and her fellow competitors grapple with the exhilarating yet perilous nature of their newfound powers. As they strive to collect Magical Candies to sustain their abilities, the stakes escalate into a ruthless battle for survival, reminiscent of "Puella Magi Madoka Magica," where the allure of magical girl tropes is undercut by existential dread and moral ambiguity.
