In a whimsical yet haunting 21st-century world where humanity’s affection for cats spirals into a surreal nightmare, "Nyaight of the Living Cat" cleverly intertwines comedy and horror. The Nyandemic virus transforms cat enthusiasts into feline creatures, creating a bizarre survival scenario that resonates with themes of identity and the fragility of humanity. Kunagi, the protagonist grappling with amnesia, embodies the struggle between his innate love for cats and the primal instinct to survive, making this series a rich exploration of psychological tension. 

As Kunagi and his companions, the infected Gaku and determined Kaoru, navigate this absurdly perilous landscape, viewers are drawn into a narrative that juxtaposes light-hearted moments with the dark undertones of existential dread. The pacing oscillates between slice-of-life interactions in the cat café and frantic escapes from the relentless feline horde, creating an atmosphere that is both quirky and unsettling. This unique blend of humor and horror evokes comparisons to "Gakkougurashi!" and "Highschool of the Dead," where ordinary settings are transformed into battlegrounds against overwhelming odds.

The emotional tone of the anime appeals to those who appreciate absurdity wrapped in a heartfelt narrative. It invites viewers to ponder the value of connection, even amidst chaos, making it particularly resonant for individuals who enjoy neurodivergent storytelling or who find solace in the companionship of pets. The absurdity of the premise, combined with genuine emotional stakes, crafts an experience that is as introspective as it is entertaining.
