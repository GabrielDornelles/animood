In the shadowy village of Ootsuka, three children—Shino, Sousuke, and Hamaji—are thrust into a harrowing existence marked by flames and despair. When their home is consumed by a cataclysmic fire, they encounter a mysterious figure who presents them with a choice: embrace a dark fate or seize a chance at survival. This pivotal moment sets the stage for a rich tapestry of emotional turmoil, as the trio navigates the complexities of loyalty, sacrifice, and the burden of power.

Five years later, the siblings find themselves under the oppressive gaze of an Imperial Church, their lives disrupted by the sinister ambitions of a cult that seeks to reclaim the demonic sword, Murasame. This quest for power and control spirals into an intense emotional journey as Sousuke, who can transform into a dog, and Shino, the reluctant bearer of Murasame's soul, must confront their own demons while racing against time to rescue their kidnapped sister. The narrative weaves elements of action, fantasy, and psychological depth, echoing the themes found in series like "Fate/Zero" and "Berserk," where the struggle between light and darkness is ever-present.

The atmosphere is steeped in tension, with a pacing that oscillates between moments of heart-wrenching introspection and pulse-pounding action. Viewers drawn to stories of familial bonds tested by adversity, themes of betrayal, and the moral quandaries surrounding the use of power will find resonance here. The series invites audiences to reflect on the nature of humanity amid chaos, making it a compelling watch for those seeking both emotional depth and thrilling adventure.
