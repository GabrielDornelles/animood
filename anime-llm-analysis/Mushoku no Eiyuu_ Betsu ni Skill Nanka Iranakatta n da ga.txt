However, this perceived flaw becomes the catalyst for an inspiring journey of self-discovery and relentless perseverance. 

Arel's ability to replicate skills through sheer effort rather than innate talent speaks to viewers who resonate with the underdog narrative, akin to the struggles seen in "My Hero Academia" or "The Rising of the Shield Hero."

The pacing is methodical yet engaging, allowing for moments of reflection amidst action-packed sequences, creating a balance that appeals to those seeking both excitement and depth.
