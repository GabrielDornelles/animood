The atmosphere is infused with a laid-back charm, echoing the serene beauty of Okinawa's landscapes, which serves as both a backdrop and a character in its own right. The pacing is gentle, allowing viewers to savor the small, poignant moments that define Teru’s journey, from awkward misunderstandings to joyful revelations.
